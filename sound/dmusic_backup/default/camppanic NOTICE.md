You may notice there are two files - ``camppanic1.wav`` and ``camppanic2.wav``, yet the music source code refers to it as ``camppanic.wav``. This is because the entire ``camppanic.wav`` weighs 32998160 bytes, which is more than GitHub web interface's upload size limit of 25 megabytes. And I am too lazy to install git or whatever and try to put it here in one piece. So, I sliced it in two in Audacity, and uploaded it here in two pieces. Yes, I know this breaks the theme, but my goal is not to upload a working addon, but rather to upload this relic of the past onto GitHub without losing any data.
