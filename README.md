The predecessor of [KM_CM's Addon](https://github.com/GarrysMod-KM_CMs_Addon). This addon has quite a large backstory. It was previously released in my telegram channel ( when I didn't use GitHub ), which I deleted due to it being useless. As I have stated in the now deleted telegram channel, this version is the last one. I have stopped developing this addon and moved onto KM_CM's Addon. The version that was last uploaded to the telegram ( this one ) was still mid development when it was uploaded, because I didn't want to wait until I succeeded or not with the new addon. There is no clean up done, this is the exact copy of what I had developed. This version was never fully finished nor officially released. The whole addon itself requires a ton of cleanup. Don't try to do it yourself, as it took steps in wrong directions due to me wanting to be "innovative", and being a rookie in the sphere of Garry's Mod addons. I will recommend you to go to the successor of it instead.
