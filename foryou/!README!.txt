As you may know, GLua is modified Lua,
And I have a 1500 lines Improvements.lua,
That heavily modifies GLua,
So I named the modifiedly-modified Lua GScript (GS,GScr).

You can find a user defined language for Notepad++ lower.
I will NOT abandon that file.
It will keep being updated when there are changes.
